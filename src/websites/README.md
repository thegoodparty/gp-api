# Website and Domain Functionality Documentation

## Database Models

### Website
The main website entity that stores campaign website data including content, status, and vanity path for public access.

### Domain  
For using a custom domain for a website. Stored AWS Route53 operationId for polling registration status. Stores the registration price and a Stripe paymentId for connecting a customer payment to the entity.

### WebsiteContact
Stores basic contact form submissions from website visitors including name, email, phone, message, and SMS consent. Just used for capturing form submissions and displaying them until a larger CRM type solution can be implemented.

### WebsiteView
Used for very basic tracking of visitor views. Frontend generates a UUID in localStorage to identify individual visitors, and will send a tracking call once per session.

### Relationships
- **Website** ↔ **Campaign**: One-to-one relationship (each campaign has one website)
- **Website** ↔ **Domain**: One-to-one relationship (each website can have one custom domain)
- **Website** ↔ **WebsiteContact**: One-to-many relationship (website has many contact submissions)
- **Website** ↔ **WebsiteView**: One-to-many relationship (website has many view records)
